**Graceful Quotes New Tab — center your new tab with devotion, wisdom & elegance.
**
Ever open a new tab and wish for a moment of calm, inspiration, or a reminder of your inner nature? This extension replaces the default new tab with a serene, beautiful interface that displays a random quote from Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, set in a tasteful glass-style card, over a choice of gradient or background image themes. Portraits, quotes, and themes rotate or can remain locked — you choose.

## ✨ Key Features

**Centered Glass Card Layout** — clean, modern, unobtrusive; the quote always remains legible.

**Circular Portrait Halo** — Gurudev’s image floats just above the card, distinct and reverent.

**Quote Rotation Modes** — choose “Every new tab” or “Once per day” rotation.

**Portrait Rotation** — cycle through multiple images automatically or fix one permanently.

**Background Modes**

• Gradient Themes: Sunrise (saffron → white), Accent White, Skydual (sky → saffron)

• Image Mode: rotate scenic photos (local or remote)

• Upload Mode: choose your own background image

• Lock Mode: freeze the current background


**Remote Data Support** — point it to GitHub Pages (or any HTTPS endpoint) to dynamically update quotes, portraits, or backgrounds without extension updates.

**Favourites & Export/Import** — bookmark your favourite quotes and export them as JSON.

**Compact Controls & Keyboard Shortcuts** — minimal UI, remains clean yet powerful.

**Privacy First** — no analytics, no data collection; everything runs locally or from your configured sources.
