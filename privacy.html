<h1>Privacy Policy for Graceful Quotes</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 2025</p>

<p>Graceful Quotes is a Chrome extension that replaces your New Tab page with inspirational quotes and backgrounds. It does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or identifying information.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>All user preferences (such as selected background, favorites, or theme settings) are stored locally on your device using Chrome’s <code>storage</code> API. This data never leaves your browser and is never sent to any server.</p>

<h2>Network Access</h2>
<p>The extension may optionally fetch static JSON and image assets (quotes, portraits, or background lists) from the developer’s GitHub Pages:
<br><code>https://pradyumnasagar.github.io/graceful-quotes-data/</code>.
These assets contain only text or image filenames—no executable code or personal information.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>Graceful Quotes does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No user data is shared with third parties.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>For any privacy-related questions, please contact:
